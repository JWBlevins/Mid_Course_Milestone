# Mid-Course Milestone: Amazon Delivery EDA

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the full data analysis process — from raw data to insights — using a dataset of Amazon deliveries.

## Repository Structure
- **data/** → contains the dataset (`amazon_delivery.csv`)  
- **notebooks/** → contains the Jupyter Notebook with all analysis steps  
- **outputs/** → contains saved plots/visualizations  
- **requirements.txt** → list of Python libraries needed to run this project  

## Steps in the Analysis
1. Data cleaning (handling missing values, fixing data types).  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (summary statistics, grouped insights).  
3. Visualizations:  
   - Histogram of Delivery Time  
   - Boxplot of Delivery Time vs Traffic  
   - Barplot of Average Delivery Time by Weather  

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Create a virtual environment.  
3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
